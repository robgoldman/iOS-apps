Thanks for the review of my project.

I had a problem when trying to add the settings button on the navigation controller.  No matter what I tried, Xcode would not let me drag the button onto the controller.  The only thing that it would let me do was to drag it onto the title bar.

Despite the power of Google, no luck.  

If I was to get past this point, I was going to add currency conversions to the app.  Big Plans were in store.

May be the problem is that I used Xcode 6.2 which is a beta version.  

Time spent on project 4.5 Hours

The application that I want to build after the class is complete is an in-car app which projects data on a HUD and broadcasts it through bluetooth.  I’d be happy to share more information on a call or in person.

I hope to get selected.  I’ve been programming real-time systems for a while.  Further information about me can be found on Linkedin /robertgoldman or in Wikipedia

Thanks for the time.
